<b>Five Bore Game Using Alpha Beta with Killer/History Heuristic</b><br><br>
<b> About the Game</b><br>
Five Bore was invented by Professor Arthur Cater for the implementation of Alpha Beta & Killer/History heuristic.<br>
Based on the game of amazons.
<br><br>
<b> Rules of the Game </b><br>
1. Five Bore is played on a 5*5 rectangular board.<br>
2. Players face each other. Each player starts with two Surfers, placed one edge cells away from their near right corner.<br>
3. On a turn, a player must move one of their Surfers up to three spaces away in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal direction, and then lob a depth charge up to three spaces away in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal direction.<br> 
4. Neither Surfers, not the depth charges they lob, may enter or cross a grid cell already occupied by a Surfer or depth charge. A player who cannot move loses the game.<br>
